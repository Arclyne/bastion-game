  Bastion - Core table creation (2 of 3)
  Engine: SQL Server 2019 or later (CON-04).

  Run order:
     1. 01_create_database.sql
     2. 02_create_tables.sql      <- this file
     3. 03_insert_test_data.sql
  Later, only when the later phase starts, run the later-phase scripts
  (their tables first, then their test data).

  Creates the core tables in the empty Bastion database: the ones
  required by the client's mandatory use cases and by the gameplay use
  cases (section "Requirements and use case prioritization"). The tables
  for the team's additions (cosmetics, shop, boxes, coins, divisions,
  friends, spectator, AI, tutorial, profile) belong to the later phase
  and are not created here (D-22).

  Contents:
     1. Preloaded catalogs (D-09)
     2. Account and access
     3. Match
     4. Rooms and chat
     5. Ranking
     6. Relationships between players
     7. Moderation and logs
     8. Procedures for physical deletes

  Conventions:
    - Tables in singular PascalCase and columns in PascalCase, in
      English, so they match EF Core's default property mapping.
    - Constraints carry their kind as a prefix: PK_ primary key,
      FK_ foreign key, UQ_ unique, CK_ check; UX_ filtered unique
      index, IX_ index.
    - Dates in UTC with DATETIME2(0).
    - Text that a person writes or reads is NVARCHAR (CON-05). The
      database uses the Modern_Spanish_100_CI_AS_SC_UTF8 collation, so
      all text accepts ñ, accented letters and any Unicode character.
    - Nothing is stored translated: catalogs and domains store a code
      that is the key of its name in the resource dictionaries (D-21).
    - Every column has a comment. The attribute tables of the data
      model document are generated from these comments, so each
      comment is the description shown in the document.

  8. Procedures for physical deletes
  The connection user has no DELETE permission. The only rows the
  application deletes in the core (mutes and blocks) are deleted with
  these procedures, which belong to dbo like the tables: thanks to
  ownership chaining, SQL Server does not check the caller's DELETE
  permission, only its EXECUTE permission.
